            <h2>Quantitative Trading/Analysis Overview</h2>
            <p>Quantitative trading and analysis involve leveraging data manipulation techniques to gain insights into market conditions and trends. By employing algorithmic functions, traders can effectively execute orders while managing risk parameters to optimize returns.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
            <p>I am proficient in Python, which I primarily use for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges and broker APIs through SDKs or REST APIs. Additionally, I have experience running AWS containers for serverless deployment, enhancing efficiency and scalability in project development.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Trading Strategy Example</h2>
            <p>One of the quantitative trading strategies I've developed involves building an RSI divergence algorithm for Kucoin Futures. This algorithm utilizes asyncio to detect RSI divergence and ATR for confirming divergence within a 1-minute timeframe. It further executes a manage_position function incorporating stop loss and take profit calculations, as well as dynamic trading size adjustments based on current balance.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Risk Management</h2>
            <p>Risk management in quantitative trading involves utilizing methods such as measuring volatility through indicators like ATR. These metrics are dynamically incorporated into pricing strategies for stop loss and take profit levels. Additionally, I implement disciplined risk limits by adjusting trading size based on current market conditions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Statistical Techniques</h2>
            <p>I employ a variety of statistical techniques for data analysis, including time series analysis, regression analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and machine learning algorithms. These techniques are applied during both backtesting and front-testing phases to validate and refine trading models.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Staying Current</h2>
            <p>My approach to staying current involves continuous learning through building quantitative models, exploring research papers, and leveraging AI to enhance my understanding of code and streamline development processes. Additionally, my focus on cryptocurrency allows me to stay abreast of emerging trends and innovations in the financial markets.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Quantitative Research Approach</h2>
            <p>My approach to quantitative research begins with formulating hypotheses based on market trends and data analysis. I gather relevant data sources and employ statistical techniques to test and refine these hypotheses. Through critical thinking and creative problem-solving, I generate new insights that inform trading strategies and decision-making processes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Handling Large Datasets</h2>
            <p>When handling large datasets, I utilize iterative data-cleaning techniques and implement threading to enhance computational efficiency. These approaches ensure that data preprocessing tasks are completed effectively, allowing for streamlined analysis and interpretation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Our Firm?</h2>
